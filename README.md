# Convex Hull Algorithm
## About Program
This is a program to visualize **linear separability dataset** with the help of convex-hull finding algorithm. It uses divide and conquer algorithm with O(n log n) overall time complexity. This algorithm sometimes called quickhull algorithm.

If you want to know more about convex hull, you can read on this site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull
